## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've learned a lot about the "source" element and using different versions of an image, depending on
the screen size.
Media queries played a big role in creating an optimal layout. This was also a project where it
really paid off to create a plan for structure and styling beforehand. Thinking about using
flexbox to change the direction of content within certain divs made the process a lot smoother.

### Continued development

For this project, I mainly used flexbox and media queries to structure my layout and make it responsive,
next time, I would like to focus on css grid, being comfortable with both will be a valuable asset.
